New day, new challenges! At (roughly) 9 o'clock, we started our day in the NSA lab at building D with a few new challenges.

## Increasing the stakes

The previously unsolved challenges were updated with hints, and even had their point values increased. It's not a surprise that many teams started focusing on these tasks, including the famous **"Audio signal challenges"** with and encrypted message and the impossible **"Impossible"** riddle, which as of today, is still unsolved and now worth twice as many points!

## Something new, and something unexpected from the past

On the other hand , the new challenges were also quite interesting. For example, we had a challenge where we had to explore New York from the Empire State Building and look for clues by using a high resolution image. The clues included buildings, street names, symbols on buildings. As a result we had to combine all of these to find the flag. It was definitely an engaging challenge!

Do you remember when you were struggling with something in a class and question yourself: *"Why do I need to know this? I am never going to use that!"* Well, today we had a challenge that was a perfect example of that.

The task was to calculate the total resistance of a circuit, with a twist: the circuit was containing a variety of resistors with different color of bands, and we had to calculate the value of the resistors based on the color codes. It was not a smooth ride, since we needed the **exact** value of the total resistance, and believe me, the numbers were not friendly looking!

## Not so Swedish dinner

The day was both challenging for the brain and stomach. And I needed something realiable, something that never dissapoints, and most importantly, something that is not pizza! It pretty much narrows down the options to one: **burgers!**.

It didn't take long until a found a place which serves Brooklyn style burgers. The place was suprsingly empty but it seemed like it was overshadowed by a nearby pub which was packed with people. Altough, they still received a lot of delivery orders, so I was not the only one who thought that burgers are a good idea, and I had high hopes for the food! Well.. not so Swedish but hey, it called "Brooklyn style" for a reason, right?

The price and the size of the burger was pretty decent, and the taste was also good. And let's not forget that the mustard was free! At first I was a bit uncomfortable because I noticed the fork and knife on the table and I was unsure if it's supposed to be one of those fancy places where you eat with a fork and knife. But that's a universal rule, the messier your hands get, the better the food is and I went with the "barbarian" eating style.
