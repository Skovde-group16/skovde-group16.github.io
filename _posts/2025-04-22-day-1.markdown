During the very first day of the security project in Skövde, we started with getting to know the environment and the location where we would spend the rest of the week. We met our Swedish colleagues, with whom we'd be spending a lot of time this week.  

The Swedish teacher duo responsible for the **NSA** (Network & System Administration) course, [Johan Zaxmy](https://www.his.se/en/about-us/staff/johan.zaxmy/) and [Jonas Ingemarsson](https://www.his.se/en/about-us/staff/jonas.ingemarsson/) gave a briefing on the CTF challenge and on the proceedings of the week. During this briefing, we also got organized into our respective teams.

## Challenge Start

Around 10AM we finished the briefing and introductions, so we got started with the CTF challenge. The challenge platform went live, our team got dubbed the name 'Master Koks' and one of the Swedish team members was appointed team captain. Ready to go, challenge start!

Something about the challenges immediately became clear: a lot of riddles would be involved. Now seems about the right time to mention that I also participated in the Cyber Security Challenge Belgium (CSCBE short). Because of this I already had some idea of what to expect of a CTF challenge. The big difference here were the riddles, so this wasn't going to be easy!  

## Finishing up

We spend the rest of the morning solving and figuring out challenges. Repeat for the afternoon after having lunch in the student restaurant on campus. Surprisingly, the food was amazing. 

We closed out the day around 5PM in a tie for first place. We've had a very productive day and gained a good feel for the structure of most challenges.  

## Kappa Bar

We finished the day by going to the Kappa Bar in the city center of Skövde. This is a great place for hanging out after school. The bar has several tables set up with monitors and game consoles. So while having a drink, you're able to play some games with friends! Here we also got our first introductions to the beers Sweden has to offer. We made sure to have a taste of most of them before heading to bed. All in all a great start to what I assume will be an amazing week in Skövde, Sweden.
