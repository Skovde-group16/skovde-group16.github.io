After a few weeks of preparation, the moment had finally arrived! I boarded my flight from Brussels to Gothenburg on Sunday evening, feeling excited and a little nervous about the adventure ahead. Since the official program would only start on Tuesday, I had some time to myself to explore.

## A Taste of Gothenburg  

After arriving at Landvetter Airport, I made my way into the city. I decided to treat myself to a proper meal, and it did not disappoint. The salmon I ordered was incredibly fresh — it almost tasted like it had been caught that afternoon. For dessert, I went with a rich chocolate ganache, smooth and full of flavor. Gothenburg clearly knew how to make a good first impression.

It was the perfect way to wrap up a long day of travel, leaving me curious about what else Sweden had to offer.

## Exploring the City  

On Monday, I met up with the rest of the group, and together we spent the day exploring Gothenburg. The city had a relaxed atmosphere, blending historic charm with vibrant modern touches. One moment that really captured this feeling was when we stumbled across three beautiful, classic buildings decorated with colorful street art at the base. The soft blue tones of the surroundings mixed perfectly with the vivid artwork, creating a striking contrast that showed off Gothenburg’s creative spirit.

The combination of old and new made it an ideal spot to stop, admire, and snap a few photos before continuing our journey through the city.


## A Visit to Gothenburg Cathedral

Later in the afternoon, we visited Gothenburg Cathedral. The building struck a beautiful balance between modern design and traditional Scandinavian architecture. Its peaceful interior offered a welcome break from the lively city streets outside.

The clean lines and natural materials gave the cathedral a calming, contemporary feel — definitely worth a visit.

## Heading to Skövde

In the evening, we made our way to Skövde, the town where our program at the University of Skövde would take place. The drive took around two hours, giving us plenty of time to chat, laugh, and share our expectations for the exciting week ahead. Between stories of past travels and guesses about the upcoming activities, the ride flew by faster than we expected.

We stayed at a cozy little guesthouse built by the owner himself, a true work of craftsmanship. When he casually mentioned, "I'm a carpenter," Bartje immediately joked, "That explains a lot!" The quality was obvious everywhere you looked. The handmade charm of the place made it feel welcoming, almost like a little Swedish home-away-from-home.

With full stomachs, new memories, and a good night's sleep ahead of us, we were ready to officially kick off the program the next day.
